# Todo-Application

## Install instructions

Please configure the `sample.env` file before proceeding with the installation. Refer to the detailed configuration
guide in [Configuration](#configuration).

For a quick and efficient setup, it is recommended to use the provided script. Find instructions
in [Script Installation](#script-installation).
> âš  **Note:** The script will automatically run the server after setup.

If you prefer a manual setup, follow the steps outlined in [Manual Installation](#manual-installation).

Once installation is complete, see how to launch the project in [How to Run](#how-to-run).

## Configuration

If you're using an online database, ensure that you update the following variable in your `sample.env` file:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Replace this with your own database credentials. Obtain your Neon database URL by following the
  instructions provided in the [Connect with psql guide](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

> **Note**:  
> If you try to run the application without setting `DATABASE_URL` or provide an invalid Neon URL, it will automatically **fallback to using a local SQLite3 database** for development purposes.
